## Introduction

This project, **Defi Empire**, is a simplified clone of a DeFi Kingdom built on the Avalanche blockchain. It includes a basic ERC20 token contract (Solidity by Example) to facilitate interactions within the kingdom.

## Smart Contract Overview

### ERC20 Token Contract

The `ERC20.sol` file contains the code for a basic ERC20 token contract. This contract includes standard functions for transferring tokens, approving spenders, and managing allowances.

- `totalSupply`: Total supply of the token.
- `balanceOf`: Mapping of addresses to their token balances.
- `allowance`: Mapping of addresses to the amount they are allowed to spend on behalf of another address.
- `name`: Name of the token ("Solidity by Example").
- `symbol`: Symbol of the token ("SOLBYEX").
- `decimals`: Number of decimal places the token can be divided into.

Events:
- `Transfer`: Triggered when tokens are transferred.
- `Approval`: Triggered when approval is granted for a spender.

Functions:
- `transfer`: Transfers tokens from the sender to a recipient.
- `approve`: Allows a spender to spend a specified amount on behalf of the sender.
- `transferFrom`: Transfers tokens from one address to another, with approval.
- `mint`: Creates new tokens and assigns them to the sender.
- `burn`: Destroys tokens held by the sender.
